A language model is a model of natural language. Language models are useful for a variety of tasks, including speech recognition, machine translation, natural language generation (generating more human-like text), optical character recognition, route optimization, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, and information retrieval.
Large language models (LLMs), currently their most advanced form, are predominantly based on transformers trained on larger datasets (frequently using words scraped from the public internet). They have superseded recurrent neural network-based models, which had previously superseded the purely statistical models, such as word n-gram language model.


## History
Noam Chomsky did pioneering work on language models in the 1950s by developing a theory of formal grammars, which became fundamental to the field of programming languages.
In 1980, statistical approaches were explored and found to be more useful for many purposes than rule-based formal grammars. Discrete representations like word n-gram language models, with probabilities for discrete combinations of words, made significant advances.
In the 2000s, continuous representations for words, such as word embeddings, began to replace discrete representations. Typically, the representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning, and common relationships between pairs of words like plurality or gender .

## Pure statistical models
In 1980, the first significant statistical language model was proposed, and during the decade IBM performed ‘Shannon-style’ experiments, in which potential sources for language modeling improvement were identified by observing and analyzing the performance of human subjects in predicting or correcting text.

## Evaluation and benchmarks
Evaluation of the quality of language models is mostly done by comparison to human created sample benchmarks created from typical language-oriented tasks. Other, less established, quality tests examine the intrinsic character of a language model or compare two such models. Since language models are typically intended to be dynamic and to learn from data they see, some proposed models investigate the rate of learning, e.g., through inspection of learning curves.
Various data sets have been developed for use in evaluating language processing systems. These include:

Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)
Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability
GLUE benchmark
Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus
Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference
Question Natural Language Inference
