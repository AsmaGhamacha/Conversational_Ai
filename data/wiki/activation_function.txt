The activation function of a node in an artificial neural network is a function that calculates the output of the node based on its individual inputs and their weights. Nontrivial problems can be solved using only a few nodes if the activation function is nonlinear.
Modern activation functions include the logistic (sigmoid) function used in the 2012 speech recognition model developed by Hinton et al; the ReLU used in the 2012 AlexNet computer vision model and in the 2015 ResNet model; and the smooth version of the ReLU, the GELU, which was used in the 2018 BERT model.


## Comparison of activation functions
Aside from their empirical performance, activation functions also have different mathematical properties:

Nonlinear
When the activation function is non-linear, then a two-layer neural network can be proven to be a universal function approximator. This is known as the Universal Approximation Theorem. The identity activation function does not satisfy this property. When multiple layers use the identity activation function, the entire network is equivalent to a single-layer model.
Range
When the range of the activation function is finite, gradient-based training methods tend to be more stable, because pattern presentations significantly affect only limited weights. When the range is infinite, training is generally more efficient because pattern presentations significantly affect most of the weights. In the latter case, smaller learning rates are typically necessary.
Continuously differentiable
This property is desirable (ReLU is not continuously differentiable and has some issues with gradient-based optimization, but it is still possible) for enabling gradient-based optimization methods. The binary step activation function is not differentiable at 0, and it differentiates to 0 for all other values, so gradient-based methods can make no progress with it.
These properties do not decisively influence performance, nor are they the only mathematical properties that may be useful. For instance, the strictly positive range of the softplus makes it suitable for predicting variances in variational autoencoders.

## Mathematical details
The most common activation functions can be divided into three categories: ridge functions, radial functions and fold functions.
An activation function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  
 is saturating if 
  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            
              |
            
            v
            
              |
            
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          |
        
        ∇
        f
        (
        v
        )
        
          |
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{|v|\to \infty }|\nabla f(v)|=0}
  
. It is nonsaturating if it is 
  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            
              |
            
            v
            
              |
            
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          |
        
        ∇
        f
        (
        v
        )
        
          |
        
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{|v|\to \infty }|\nabla f(v)|\neq 0}
  
. Non-saturating activation functions, such as ReLU, may be better than saturating activation functions, because they are less likely to suffer from the vanishing gradient problem.
