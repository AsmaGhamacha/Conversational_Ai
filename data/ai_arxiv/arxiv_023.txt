Title: Evaluating the Social Impact of Generative AI Systems in Systems and Society

Abstract:
Generative AI systems across modalities, ranging from text, image, audio, and
video, have broad social impacts, but there exists no official standard for
means of evaluating those impacts and which impacts should be evaluated. We
move toward a standard approach in evaluating a generative AI system for any
modality, in two overarching categories: what is able to be evaluated in a base
system that has no predetermined application and what is able to be evaluated
in society. We describe specific social impact categories and how to approach
and conduct evaluations in the base technical system, then in people and
society. Our framework for a base system defines seven categories of social
impact: bias, stereotypes, and representational harms; cultural values and
sensitive content; disparate performance; privacy and data protection;
financial costs; environmental costs; and data and content moderation labor
costs. Suggested methods for evaluation apply to all modalities and analyses of
the limitations of existing evaluations serve as a starting point for necessary
investment in future evaluations. We offer five overarching categories for what
is able to be evaluated in society, each with their own subcategories:
trustworthiness and autonomy; inequality, marginalization, and violence;
concentration of authority; labor and creativity; and ecosystem and
environment. Each subcategory includes recommendations for mitigating harm. We
are concurrently crafting an evaluation repository for the AI research
community to contribute existing evaluations along the given categories. This
version will be updated following a CRAFT session at ACM FAccT 2023.
