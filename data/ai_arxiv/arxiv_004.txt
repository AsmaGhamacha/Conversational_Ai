Title: Gender Bias in Machine Translation

Abstract:
Machine translation (MT) technology has facilitated our daily tasks by
providing accessible shortcuts for gathering, elaborating and communicating
information. However, it can suffer from biases that harm users and society at
large. As a relatively new field of inquiry, gender bias in MT still lacks
internal cohesion, which advocates for a unified framework to ease future
research. To this end, we: i) critically review current conceptualizations of
bias in light of theoretical insights from related disciplines, ii) summarize
previous analyses aimed at assessing gender bias in MT, iii) discuss the
mitigating strategies proposed so far, and iv) point toward potential
directions for future work.
