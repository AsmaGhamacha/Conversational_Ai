Title: Dynamic Planning in Open-Ended Dialogue using Reinforcement Learning

Abstract:
Despite recent advances in natural language understanding and generation, and
decades of research on the development of conversational bots, building
automated agents that can carry on rich open-ended conversations with humans
"in the wild" remains a formidable challenge. In this work we develop a
real-time, open-ended dialogue system that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to
power a bot's conversational skill at scale. Our work pairs the succinct
embedding of the conversation state generated using SOTA (supervised) language
models with RL techniques that are particularly suited to a dynamic action
space that changes as the conversation progresses. Trained using crowd-sourced
data, our novel system is able to substantially exceeds the (strong) baseline
supervised model with respect to several metrics of interest in a live
experiment with real users of the Google Assistant.
