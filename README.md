# Conversational AI Study Assistant

Welcome to my **Conversational AI Study Assistant** project!

This is a lightweight yet powerful educational tool designed to assist students and AI enthusiasts in learning and exploring foundational and advanced topics in **Artificial Intelligence** using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach 😊

---

## Features:

* **Knowledge Augmented Generation**: Uses a custom RAG pipeline that retrieves top documents before generating answers.
* **Smart Retrieval**: FAISS-based document search over a curated set of AI knowledge bases (Wikipedia, ArXiv abstracts, intro notes).
* **LLM-Powered Generation**: Uses local models (e.g., via `llama3` through Ollama or similar).
* **CodeCarbon Integration**: Tracks CO₂ emissions and energy usage for each query.
* **Evaluation Suite**: Benchmarks QA performance and logs accuracy & latency.
* **Streamlit Interface**: Clean, themed, and interactive UI with Chibi Alan Turing for fun :D

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AsmaGhamacha/Conversational_Ai.git
cd Conversational_Ai
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Data Preparation

Scrape Wikipedia or ArXiv papers to populate the knowledge base:

```bash
python scripts/wiki_scraper.py
python scripts/download_arxiv_papers.py
```

Embeddings and index are automatically created when running the app for the first time.

---

## Evaluation

To evaluate the agent's performance:

```bash
python src/evaluation.py
```

This uses the file `data/eval_questions.jsonl` and logs:

* Accuracy (%)
* Average Latency (s)
* Per-query results to `logs/eval_log.csv`

---

## Example CLI Usage

```bash
python main.py
# Enter your question:
> What is reinforcement learning?
```

---

## Launch Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app includes:

* Query input
* output formatting (questions and answers's history is saved)
* CO2 impact and duration per response

---

## Sample Evaluation Output

```
Accuracy: 80.0%
Average Latency: 6.91s
```

---
## Running the Evaluation Script (`evaluation.py`)
This script evaluates the quality of the answers generated by the model using a set of predefined questions and expected answers stored in `data/wiki/eval_questions.jsonl`.

### 🔑 API Key Setup (Local Use Only)

To run the evaluation locally, you'll need an API key from [Together.ai](https://api.together.ai/). This key is used to call the language model **deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B** .

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into it.
3. Replace the placeholder with your actual API key:

   ```env
   TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_actual_together_api_key_here
   

## Run the Evaluation

Once the `.env` file is set up, run the evaluation script with:

```bash
python src/evaluation.py
```
